# Leaf Tracking for plant top-down images
 A leaf tracking repository for top-down images on arabidopsis. This repository has been created as part of the research paper: DOI https://doi.org/10.1186/s13007-024-01138-x <br>
 ![Leaf Tracking Example GIF](Figures/A1_Fmp_masks.gif "Leaf-track-example1")

### Usage
Clone the repository with:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Fedjurrui/Leaf-Tracking.git
```
Move inside the folder:
```powershell
cd Leaf-Tracking
```
Then install the requirements:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements_pip.txt
```

Open using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) the folder and the open the Example_run.ipynb notebook file. Be mindful that it is a jupyter notebook, so if you have not worked with notebooks you might find the [documentation on jupyter notebook in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) usefull.

### Model weights
The model weights are stored as a lfs and github has a limit on the transference bandswith of this file. If you get an error while cloning the repository or you find that the folder Leaf-Tracking/Models is empty, you can find the weights file for the model here:\
[https://huggingface.co/fedjurrui/Leaf-Tracking/blob/main/Leaf_Segmentation_MaskedRCNN_7_7_2022_8h.h5](https://huggingface.co/fedjurrui/Leaf-Tracking/blob/main/Leaf_Segmentation_MaskedRCNN_7_7_2022_8h.h5)\
Download the weights there and copy them to Leaf-Tracking/Models.



### Recomendations
It is highly encouraged to use a workstation or cluster with a GPU. Inference times are greatly improved doing so eventhough it is not strictly required and the code has been prepared to run on CPU.
